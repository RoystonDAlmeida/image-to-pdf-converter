## How It Works

1. **Image Selection**: The app uses an Intent to open the image gallery and allows users to select multiple images.
2. **Bitmap Conversion**: Selected images are converted into Bitmap format for processing.
3. **PDF Creation**: The app utilizes Android's `PdfDocument` class to create a new PDF document and draw each Bitmap onto its pages.
4. **File Saving**: The generated PDF is saved in the device's storage, making it accessible for sharing or viewing later.

### Example Code Snippet

Hereâ€™s a simple code snippet demonstrating how images are converted into a PDF:

	```java
	   {
		    PdfDocument.PageInfo pageInfo = new PdfDocument.PageInfo.Builder((int) max1, 1300, 1).create();
		    PdfDocument.Page mypage1 = pdfDocument.startPage(pageInfo);
		    Canvas canvas = mypage1.getCanvas();
		    scaledbitmap = Bitmap.createScaledBitmap(bitmap, (int) max1, 1300, true);

		    canvas.drawBitmap(scaledbitmap, 2, 1, paint);
		    pdfDocument.finishPage(mypage1);
		    
		    pdfDocument.writeTo(new FileOutputStream(file1));
	    }
	```
